# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Michele Meazzini

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering** at the **University of Pisa**, after earning my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Engineering** from the same university.

I live in **Altopascio (LU), Italy**, and beyond my academic and professional interests, I'm really enjoy **playing videogames** and **fitness**.  
This GitHub space is where I share my projects, ideas, and experiments in the fields of AI, data engineering, and software development.
